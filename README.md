# UnityFMODProject

Project Notes

- Unity Version 2018.3.0b11
- Unity -> FMOD settings -> FMOD project file Path was set for this folder: 
	C:\Users\sbgjo\Documents\C15713979_Audio_Assignment_3\FMOD_Project\AudioAssignment3

- FMOD project file path will be updated when unzipped onto different computer. 
- Likely that you will have to add the new FMOD project file path to Unity->FMOD->Edit Settings->FMOD project file Path.

- Refresh banks, save the project and restart Unity. 

- If you try to run the project before restarting there may be some meta file issues that cause "FMOD event (event name) path not found errors. Save project and restart solves this.

- Try the windows build!
